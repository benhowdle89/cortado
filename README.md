# Cortado

[Docs](http://benhowdle89.github.io/cortado/)

## Features

* Custom Events
* Provides native DOM wrappers, ie. `this.$('.myEls')`
* Template Engine agnostic
* Use an existing HTML element or let Cortado create an element for you
* Built-in methods such as; `init`, `render`, `close`, `remove`

## What would I use this for?

* If you don't want to use jQuery for a smaller project
* If you want easy organisation of your DOM JS
* If you're used to working with MV* frameworks, but they're overkill for your smaller project
* You want organisation around your usage of Templating engines
